# A-simple-ChatBOT-career-base-
Developed an NLP-based chatbot using Python to provide career guidance, leveraging techniques like Bag of Words, lemmatization, and deep learning. The model accurately matches user inputs to intents, offering relevant responses, and was trained using a sequential neural network with softmax output.

**Career Advice Chatbot**
An NLP-based chatbot built in Python, providing career guidance through dynamic and accurate responses. It utilizes machine learning techniques such as Bag of Words, lemmatization, and deep learning to understand user queries and deliver relevant career advice.
**Overview**
This project features an intelligent chatbot that helps users navigate their career paths by answering questions related to different fields. The chatbot interprets user inputs, matches them to predefined intents, and generates responses using natural language processing.
Features
**Intent Recognition**: Understands user inputs and maps them to predefined career-related intents.
Context-Aware Responses: Generates relevant responses based on user input.
Bag of Words (BoW) Model: Transforms text into numeric vectors for model training.
Deep Learning-Based Classification: A neural network to predict intents and generate responses.
Lemmatization and Preprocessing: Ensures input is normalized for accurate intent classification.
Technologies Used
Python: A programming language for the implementation of the project.
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the neural network model.
Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK): For text processing, tokenization, and lemmatization.
NumPy: For numerical operations and data manipulation.
JSON: Used to store intents, patterns, and responses.
Dataset
The chatbot is powered by a dataset stored in a JSON file (intents.json), containing various career-related intents. Each intent includes:
Tag: Represents the intent.
Patterns: Sample user queries.
Responses: Possible replies to the queries.
Example:
JSON
Copy code
{
  "intents": [
    {
      "tag": "greetings",
      "patterns": ["Hello", "Hi", "Hey"],
      "responses": ["Hello! How can I assist you?"]
    },
    {
      "tag": "case",
      "patterns": ["Tell me about Computer Science", "What is CSE?"],
      "responses": ["Computer Science is a dynamic field with vast opportunities."]
    }
  ]
}
**Project Structure**
Preprocessing: User inputs are cleaned, tokenized, and lemmatized to create numerical vectors.
Model Training: A neural network is trained on the processed data to classify intents.
Prediction: The chatbot predicts the correct intent and generates a relevant response.
Future Enhancements
Expanded Dataset: Add more career fields and intents.
Contextual Conversations: Implement context handling for multi-turn conversations.
GUI Integration: Develop a graphical interface to enhance user interaction.
